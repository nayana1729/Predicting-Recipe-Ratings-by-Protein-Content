# Protein Content and Recipe Rating Analysis
## Introduction
Protein content in food is something that has become incredibly trendy. Due to the fitness industry and influencers from the same pushing the narrative that high-protein foods will lead to more muscle growth and athletic performance, I wanted to explore the relationship between protein content and recipe rating. This question helps us better understand nutrition and its impact on consumer preferences. I will utilize two datasets, called ratings and recipes, from food.com, a popular recipe-sharing website containing detailed data from 2008 onwards. There are 731927 rows in the first dataset with 5 columns and 83782 rows in the second dataset with 12 columns. For this project, the relevant columns include:

Ratings:
'rating' - rating given

Recipes:
'minutes' - Minutes taken to prepare recipe
'nutrition - Nutrition information in the form [calories (#), total fat (PDV), sugar (PDV), sodium (PDV), protein (PDV), saturated fat (PDV), carbohydrates (PDV)]; PDV stands for “percentage of daily value”
'description' - User-provided description
